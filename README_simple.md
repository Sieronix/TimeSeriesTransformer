# **Waveformer: A Tool for Time Series Predictions**

Waveformer is a Python-based project that helps you understand and predict patterns in data over time. Itâ€™s perfect for analyzing things like stock prices, weather patterns, or anything that changes with time. The heart of the project is a **Transformer model**, a fancy type of AI that learns from data to make future predictions.

## **How It Works**

1. **Preprocessing**:  
   Cleans the data, creates averages, and splits it into small chunks for training.  

2. **Training**:  
   Teaches the AI model using historical data to predict future values.  

3. **Evaluation**:  
   Tests how well the model works and shows results in colorful graphs.
